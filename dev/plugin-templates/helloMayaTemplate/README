helloMayaTemplate - A GNU style Maya plugin template

	helloMayaTemplate is a GNU style example Maya plugin project. It allows
	the maintainer to use the GNU build system to configure and deploy a Maya
	plugin project. It also allows the end user to use the well known
	combination of commands "./configure", "make" and "make install" to use
	the plugin. It is still in its very early stages and many things might not
	work properly yet. I encourage you to give it a go and report back your
	experiences wheter successfull or not. You are more than welcome to
	contribute your ideas and changes to this project. See Bug reporting
	secton for contact details.


Quick start - How to use this template for your own project

	1. Copy and rename the the entire template folder to your dev folder e.g.
	   "cp -R helloMayaTemplate ~/dev/helloMaya"
	2. Edit the first two lines of configure.ac with the information of your
	   package details.
	3. Edit the source files under ./src folder.
	4. Edit the ./src/Makefile.am to reflect your changes.
	5. Edit the README, NEWS, AUTHORS, COPYING, COPYING.LESSER and ChangeLog
	   files to your liking.
	6. In the project root folder run "autoreconf -i -f".
	7. Run "./configure"
	8. Run "make"
	9. Run "sudo make install"
	10. To create a tar ball for distributing your plugin run "make distcheck"


Documentation

	At the time of writing this the current version of Maya is 2014 which
	requires gcc/g++ version 4.1.2 for ABI compatibility. See your system
	documentation and/or the Maya API Guide for information on how to obtain a
	copy. The configure.ac file has been written with this in mind. It looks
	for g++412 gcc412 commands for compiling the project which should be in
	your search path. On my system I have compiled gcc412 from sources and
	installed it to /opt/gcc412 then created g++412 and gcc412
	symlinks in /usr/bin.

	You should have an environment variable called MAYA_LOCATION pointing
	to the root folder of your Maya installation e.g.
	/usr/autodesk/maya2014-x64/

	You should also have an environment variable called MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH
	pointing to the folder where Maya can find your plugin.so file. "make
	install" makes use of this folder too.

	Please see the Maya API Guide at http://www.autodesk.com for general
	information about setting up your build environment.

	Please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system and
	http://airs.com/ian/configure/ for more information on the GNU build
	system.

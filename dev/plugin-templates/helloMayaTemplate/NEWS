27 November 2013 - Version 0.2.0 released

	This release adds basic compiler compatibility checks. It does not do any
	"this gcc works best with this maya version" checks yet though. This will
	be implemented in later releases. Currently it looks for g++ version
	4.1.2.


24 November 2013 - Initial release of version 0.1.1
